# 🚴‍♂️ AdventureWorks Power BI Sales & Customer Insights Dashboard

This repository showcases a complete Power BI project I developed as part of the **Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence** course, under the guidance of [Chris Dutton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-dutton/) and [Aaron Parry](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaron-parry/).

I played the role of a **Business Intelligence Analyst** at AdventureWorks Cycles, a fictional manufacturing company. Using sales and customer data from 2015–2017, I built an interactive dashboard to drive business insights and decision-making.
