# 🚴‍♂️ AdventureWorks Power BI Sales & Customer Insights Dashboard

This repository contains a full BI workflow project built using **Power BI Desktop**, as part of the **Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence** course, guided by [Chris Dutton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-dutton/) and [Aaron Parry](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaron-parry/).

I played the role of a **Business Intelligence Analyst** at AdventureWorks Cycles, a fictional manufacturing company, and developed a dynamic, interactive dashboard to analyze sales and customer trends from 2015 to 2017.
